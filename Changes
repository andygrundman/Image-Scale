Revision history for Image:Scale

0.14    2017-11-27
        - Trying to resize certain kinds of corrupt JPEGs from an in-memory variable could get
          stuck in an infinite loop.

0.13    2016-11-24
        - save_jpeg() and save_png() will now properly stringify when passed something such as a
          Path::Tiny object.
        - Added back support for giflib 4.1.x.

0.12    2016-05-08
        - Skip JPEG binary comparison tests by default, as they are broken with libjpeg-turbo.
        - Correctly find libjpeg-turbo on Linux systems where some headers are installed
          in /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu
        - Removed hints/darwin.pl, don't try to be smarter than Perl about how to build things.

0.11    2015-10-07
        - Added $img->resized_height() and $img->resized_width() accessors that
          return the post-resize dimensions of the image. This can be useful if you
          only specified one dimension and need to know the other dimension that
          was calculated by the module. (RT #80269)
        - Changed ARM fixed_mul assembly code to not round the result, in order to
          match the output from x86 and C versions and pass the tests. (RT #93417)
        - Fixed GIF compilation when using giflib >= 5.0. (RT #106749)
        - Compilation fixes for newer OSX versions.
        - Point at new GitHub repo.

0.10    2015-08-23
        - GIF support now requires giflib >= 4.2.0, due to API changes.
          libungif is no longer supported. (RT #101679)
        - Fixed call to png_memcpy no longer working (RT #89927)

0.09    (unreleased)
        - Bug 17573, fixed several places where we could divide by 0.
        - Fixed JPEG version detection for libjpeg-turbo.
        - Fixed GIF library detection when using only --with-gif-includes switch.

0.08    2011-08-24
        - Forgot to add some new test files to the manifest.
        - Updated the Makefile and Win32 instructions to use libjpeg-turbo-1.1.1.

0.07    2011-08-24
        - Protect against resizing to a 0-width or 0-height image.
        - Use libungif if giflib is not found. (Max Soul√©)
        - Fix build issue when building a non-x86 version using libjpeg-turbo's
          header file.
        - Hide orientation warning when EXIF orientation value is 0 (invalid but
          common for some reason).

0.06    2010-09-20 18:40:00
        - JPEG: Don't abort on fatal read errors if we have already processed
          some lines from the image. An image with blank space is better than
          no image at all.

0.05    2010-09-20 14:30:00
        - Faster resize when image doesn't have an alpha channel.
        - Faster JPEG compression when using libjpeg-turbo.

0.04    2010-09-17 15:40:00
        - More fixes for CPAN testers.

0.03    2010-09-16 18:00:00
        - Fixed compilation on Windows.

0.02    2010-09-16 17:00:00
        - Fixed crash when reading JPEG images with large Exif tags.
        - Improved fixed-point performance for x86.
        - Fixes for various test failures.

0.01    2010-09-08 23:40:00
        - Initial release.
